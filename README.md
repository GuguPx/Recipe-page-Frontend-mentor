### What I learned

I’m using what I’ve learned in HTML and CSS to fully solidify the content in my mind, and this project served as a way to refresh basic concepts that I had overlooked. I managed to finish it in 12 hours, and for my first project, I’m happy with the result.

I had a bit of trouble adding this table because I didn't know how to make it horizontal, but after some research, I managed to figure it out.:

```html
  <table class="table-nutition">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Calories</th>
                        <td>277Kcal</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Carbs</th>
                        <td>0g</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Fat</th>
                        <td>20g</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Protein</th>
                        <td>22g</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
```

### Continued development

I'm learning Frontend to strengthen the concepts and enter programming in a more relaxed way, but I have a strong interest in Backend, probably due to my autism lol.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank W3Schools a lot, which helped me a lot, and ChatGPT, which helped me look at my project with a different perspective.
P.S.: I didn’t use any code from ChatGPT or anything like that, I only used it to ask some questions about certain properties.
